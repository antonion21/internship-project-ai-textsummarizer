# AI Text Summarizer

This project was created as a personal learning exercise while preparing internship applications.  
The goal was to gain practical experience with **AI/NLP**, **Docker containerization**, and simple **cloud deployment**.  
It demonstrates how a small machine learning service can be packaged and shared as a reproducible application ‚Äî while also serving as a showcase project in my CV.
